## Development Guidelines

### KISS Principles

- Start with simplest implementation
- Add complexity only when needed
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use clear, descriptive naming

### Testing Strategy

- Test each phase before moving to next
- Use browser DevTools for WebRTC debugging
- Test on different networks (wifi, mobile data, VPN)
- Use multiple devices/browsers simultaneously

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't skip TURN server testing
- Always handle peer connection failures
- Clean up media streams on unmount
- Handle browser permission denials
- Test with camera/mic disabled scenarios
