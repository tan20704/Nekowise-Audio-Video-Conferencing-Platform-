### Known Limitations

- ⚠️ Mesh topology limits to ~10 participants (consider SFU for more)
- ⚠️ No server-side recording yet
- ⚠️ No end-to-end encryption (E2EE)
- ⚠️ No mobile apps (web-only)
- ⚠️ No simulcast support yet

## [0.1.0] - Initial Development

### Added

- Basic WebRTC functionality
- User authentication
- Room creation and joining
- Video/audio streaming
- Basic UI components

## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

- None (first major release)

#### New Dependencies

```bash
# Client
npm install

# Server
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:

```bash
# Server - No changes needed

# Client - No changes needed
```

#### Database Migrations

No migrations required. The Room schema has been enhanced with participant tracking, but is backward compatible.
